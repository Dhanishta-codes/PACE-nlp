most vital tools.
They measure aerosol optical depth (AOD), which
indicates the amount of light that aerosols scatter and
absorb. An AOD of less than 0.05 signifies a clear
sky, while a value of 1 indicates hazy conditions, and
values above 2 or 3 represent very high aerosol
concentrations.
Land-based and airborne instruments complement
NASAâ€™s satellites. AERONET is a global network of sun
photometers that measures aerosols from the ground,
such as this station in the Canadian Arctic (top).
Despite these advancements, significant questions
remain regarding aerosols' competing impacts.

The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) was the first satellite instrument capable of
monitoring aerosol optical depth from space,
starting in the late 1970s. Since then, instruments like
the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR)
and the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have improved
capabilities, allowing for more accurate assessments
of aerosols over land and sea.
